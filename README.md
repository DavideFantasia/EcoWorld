this was my graduation project in high school, we had to create a fake brand for whom to create a site. 

there is an entire pdf document in witch you can find any information in regard of the project, unfortunately it's all in italian.

You need to run the project on a local server to make it work, many pieces of it may be broken (98% because of the SQL database)

If you need any help understanding what all of this is about, don't wait to contact me, I dont remember much about it, but i can work with you to fix it if needed

Mainly, the focus of the project was to use a Tello Drone via web, logging in the website as an admin and going to the personal page.
The website is based on a template found online at the time that i modified and linked with many other pages (full of place-holder texts).

There were a mySQL database behind the site, but I don't think it's functional at the moment, if you happen to try it, let me know
